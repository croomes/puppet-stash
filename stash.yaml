# 1.) Place this file in your hieradata directory
# 2.) Modify the database settings below according to your setup
#
# Atlassian Stash Git Enterprise Source Control Server
stash_name: stash
stash_version: 1.2.2
stash_package_format: zip

# Directory where the webapp will run from
stash_install_dir: /opt/stash
# If you can put this on another filesystem, and even better, a fs that's
# on another physical disk, you will be happier, but not required
stash_home_dir: /opt/stash-home

# Database configuration - please change these according to your setup
# Comment out or uncomment for your db product as this value is also
# overloaded as the jdbc driver db
stash_db: postgresql
#stash_db: mysql
#stash_db: oracle

stash_dbdriver: org.postgresql.Driver

# Change these values to your stash database credentials
stash_dbuser: stashadm
stash_dbpassword: stashadm

# Change port depending on your db product
stash_dbport: 5432
#stash_dbport: 3306
#stash_dbport: 1521

# Change if your database isn't on localhost.  This module will only check
# to make sure that the service is running and start it if it is not on
# localhost db's only.  So if your remote database, which is suggested, isn't
# available, that's your fault.
stash_dbserver: localhost

# Tomcat configuration
# TODO because I'm never a fan of the stock tomcat settings
stash_javahome: /opt/java/jdk1.6.0_33
stash_jvm_xmx: 1024m
stash_jvm_optional: -XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
#stash_jvm_optional: -XX:NewSize=256m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m -XX:SurvivorRatio=16
# the New and SR figures are purely optional
# for heap dumps add -XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
# by default stash has 256m permgen which is a good setting to go with
